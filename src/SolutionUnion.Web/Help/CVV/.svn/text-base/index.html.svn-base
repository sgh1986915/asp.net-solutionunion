                  What is a (CVV) Credit Card Code?</h1>
               <p>
                  For <strong>Visa, MasterCard, and Discover</strong>
                  cards, the card code is the last 3 digit number located on the back of your card
                  on or above your signature line. For an <strong>American Express</strong> card, it is the
                  4 digits on the FRONT above the end of your card number.
               </p>
               <p>
                  To help reduce fraud in the card-not-present
                  environment, credit card companies have introduced a card code program. Visa® calls this code Card Verification Value (CVV); 
                  MasterCard® calls it Card Validation Code (CVC); Discover®
                  calls it Card ID (CID). <strong>The card code is a three- or four- digit security code that
                     is printed on the back of cards. The number typically appears at the end of the
                     signature panel. </strong>
               </p>
               <p>
                  This helps validate that a genuine
                  card is being used during a transaction, especially in situations like mail orders,
                  telephone orders or Internet orders where the card is not present. All MasterCard
                  cards, both credit and debit, were required to contain CVC2 by January 1, 1997;
                  all Visa cards must contain CVV2 by January 1, 2001. Beginning in October 2003,
                  Discover requires the card code for all Discover transactions. By using the card
                  code results along with the Address Verification Service (AVS), we can make more
                  informed decisions about whether to accept transactions and reduce fraudulent transactions.

                  What if I can't find or can't read my Card Code?</h2>
                  Then leave the Card Code field on
                  the order form blank. The merchant credit card processor makes a decision whether
                  to accept or decline your card. If there is an issue, then we will contact you directly
                  to discuss.
